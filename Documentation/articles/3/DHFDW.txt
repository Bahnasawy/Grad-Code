Problem:
	Detecting deception and hoaxes in writing style to mask the author's true identity, and distinguishing the true documents from the fraudulent.

Solution:
	Using stylometry, machine learning, and a large feature-set.

Algorithm Name:
	Information Gain Ratio

Pros and Cons:
	Pros: The feature set used was content-independant, and can be used to detect texts with different subjects.
	Cons: The results on the EBG(Extended-Brennan-Greenstadt) were much better than the imitation contest participants, which could mean that it might be difficult to optimize for a real world scenario.
