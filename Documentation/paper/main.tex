\begin{abstract}
    An author's style can be defined through a set of features that are almost unique to each author,
    analysis of these features is called Stylometry. This paper; in collaboration with MSA's Faculty of Languages;
    will explore new features that haven't been extensively researched before or haven't been researched at all, in addition to minimizing the number of words needed to make an analysis.
    The goal is to create a tool that can generate a preliminary prediction on the degrees of similarity between suspected authors and the disputed writings,
    with the focus being on forensics and criminal linguistics, which means the dataset will mostly include social-media posts, emails, and text messages.
