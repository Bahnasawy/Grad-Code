\chapter{Results and Evaluation}

\section{Results}
\subsection{Parser}
The parser produces accurate results with a degree of certainty that matches the tokenizer accuracy. It only fails if given an incorrect Regex pattern, but it is an unavoidable limitation so no action was taken to fix it.

\subsection{Analysis}
The system can successfully measure the probability of similarity between authors and the disputed text, but the accuracy requires rigorous testing since it needs a significantly large data set. The tests will be conducted by collecting authors from similar genres and separating them into classes, taking a test text as a control, then they will be passed through the system and the outputs will be logged and studied to calculate the system's accuracy.

\subsection{User interface}
The user interface achieves its purpose, but is in need of clarifications, and user experience improvements since at this stage it requires exploration and/or trial and error to operate.

Sections of the interface were tested for validity by using invalid data formats or removing them entirely. The only failed test is the corpus loader as it needs to be able to reject poorly formatted corpus.

The only missing feature is the analysis editor as it needed a structural reformation of the analysis format that would've taken too much time that was not available.
