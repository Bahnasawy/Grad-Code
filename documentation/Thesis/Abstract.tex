    Linguistic professionals have been manually analyzing and extracting sylometric features from texts for a long time, which is a tedious and time-consuming process. Previous software have attempted to aid linguists to search for said features, however most of them are either expensive or were counter-intuitive to use. This project aims to fix these issues by offering an easy to use interface with a simple but powerful set of tools(Regular Expression, NLP), using Obama's presidential speeches for validation, in order to achieve the desired objectives with high accuracy.
