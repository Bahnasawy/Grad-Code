\chapter{Conclusions and Future work}

\section{Conclusion}
The project's goal is to provide an easy to use tool that requires minimal training that parses text for stylometric features and provide analysis if authorship attribution is needed. The system achieves this by using nltk and regular expression. While the system achieves its purpose, it is heavily dependent on the user submitting valid inputs and formats, with little no protection from mistakes.

\section{Future Work}
The parser could be vastly improved by introducing machine learning techniques for more accurate and more consistent results. The UI/UX also needs an overhaul to accommodate for inexperienced/new users. The system could also be improved by adding support for more file formats, as it only supports plain text files that are heavily reliant on the user to be formatted correctly.
