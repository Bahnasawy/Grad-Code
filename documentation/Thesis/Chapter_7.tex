\chapter{Conclusions and Future work}

%Each object has a normal functionality rather than interaction, the user has to decide when he wants to use object for interaction and when he wants to use it naturally. 


\section{General Rules}
The Conclusions section should be a summary of the aims of project and a restatement of its
main results, i.e. what has been learned and what it has achieved. An effective set of
conclusions should not introduce new material. Instead it should briefly draw out, summarize,
combine and reiterate the main points that have been made in the body of the project report
and present opinions based on them.
The Conclusions section marks the end of the project report proper. Be honest and objective
in your conclusions.

\section{Future Work}

\section{General Rules}

It is quite likely that by the end of your project you will not have achieved all that you
planned at the start; and in any case, your ideas will have grown during the course of the
project beyond what you could hope to do within the available time. The Future Work section
is for expressing your unrealized ideas. It is a way of recording that I have thought about
this, and it is also a way of stating what you would like to have done if only you had not run
out of time1. A good Future Work section should provide a starting point for someone else to
continue the work which you have begun.
